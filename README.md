# nCoVis Choropleth

### About

Visualization of the Novel Coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, China. 

Compared with other existing visualization projects for nCoV-2019, nCoVis Choropleth collects and visualizes data of prefecture-level cities (instead of provinces), as well as other indicators such as infection density (infections per kmÂ²) and infection ratio (%).

From July 17 2020, the project will be visualizing global data instead. You can still access the legacy verion (the Chinese prefecture-level cities map) through the link provided in the page.
